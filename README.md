# Personal website

Runway-inspired single-page personal website built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## Structure

- `index.html` scene-based content layout
- `styles.css` industrial showspace art direction and responsive styling
- `script.js` scene cues, nav state, and canvas lighting effects
- `resume.pdf` downloadable CV

## Design direction

- Industrial Showspace: central runway, alternating scene wings, lighting cues
- Zero frameworks, zero build step
- One-page narrative with quick recruiter navigation
- Performance-first tuning: system font stack, deferred heavy effects, lighter first paint
